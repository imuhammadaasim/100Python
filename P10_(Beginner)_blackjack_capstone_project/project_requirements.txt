Card Values:
Joker, Queen, and King have a value of 10.
Ace can have a value of either 1 or 11.
All other cards have their face value.

Initial Dealing:
Two cards are randomly dealt to the user.
Two cards are randomly dealt to the computer, but only the first card is shown to the user.

User Actions:
After receiving the initial two cards, the user decides whether to "hit" (request another card) or "stand" (keep the current hand).
If the user's total sum exceeds 21 after hitting, the user busts, and the game ends with the computer winning.
If the user stands, the turn passes to the computer.

Computer Actions:
The computer's strategy is to hit until its total sum is at least 17.
If the computer's total sum exceeds 21, it busts, and the user wins.
If the computer stands, the game proceeds to determine the winner.

Determining the Winner:
If either the user or the computer has a total sum of 21 with the initial two cards (blackjack), that player wins.
If both the user and the computer have blackjack, it's a draw.
If neither the user nor the computer busts and both stand, compare their total sums.
If the user's total sum is higher than the computer's, the user wins.
If the computer's total sum is higher than the user's, the computer wins.
If both have the same total sum, it's a draw.

Ace Value Handling:
If an ace is drawn and adding its value as 11 keeps the total sum below or equal to 21, consider the ace as 11.
If adding an ace as 11 would cause the total sum to exceed 21, consider the ace as 1.
